CS:6370 Natural Language Processing, readability analysis of natural language documents

## Folder structure:
The folder structure is as follows,
 - `beta/` contains individual folders to test and experiment code. Add and test your code in **your respective folders only**.
 - `v01/` contains the **actual working, integrated code** at any given point. We **should not update** the files in this folder without testing locally. It has the following folders and files,
   - `data/` contains all the data used for our analysis of natural language documents.
   - `lib/` contains all the re-usable scripts which perform individual small tasks for our final analysis. 
   - `start_analysis.py` the main code which needs to be executed to start the analysis of a document. This imports the code from scripts in the `lib/` directory and in addition, has a final logic to complete the analysis.
   - `report/` contains all the required `.tex` or `.lyx` or `.pdf` or `.doc` files, images and any other files required, including the final report to be submitted.
