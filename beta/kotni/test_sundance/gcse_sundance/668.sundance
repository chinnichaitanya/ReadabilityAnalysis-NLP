Original : If you know the gear ratio, and the speed input at the driver gear, you can calculate the speed output at the driven gear using the formula: Output speed = input speed ÷ gear ratio So if the gear ratio is 4 and the driver gear is revolving at 200 = revolutions per minute, a measure of speed of rotation output speed = 200 ÷ 4 = 50 rpm Post ideas and discuss Design and Technology here.
