Original : When you are converting one sort of unit to another, you need to know how many smaller units are needed to make 1 larger unit (eg 1000m When converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit (eg m When converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit (eg cm = 100cm × 100cm = 10 000cm You are converting from a smaller unit (cm = 50 000 ÷ 10 000 = 5m = 10mm × 10mm × 10mm = 1000mm You are converting from a larger unit (cm = 10 × 1000 = 10 000mm Can you match Viral Vinnie's appetite for English, Maths and Science?
