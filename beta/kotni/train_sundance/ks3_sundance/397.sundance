Original : Work out the value of the following: a) 4 × 5 - 3 × 2 b) (2 + 3) × (5 - 1) a) In BODMAS multiplication comes before subtraction, so work out the multiplication first and then do the subtraction: 4 × 5 - 3 × 2 = 20 - 6 = 14 (2 + 3) × (5 - 1) = 5 × 4 = 20 c) In BODMAS division comes before addition, so 2 + 6 ÷ 2 = 2 + 3 = 5 8 - (6 - 1) = 8 - 5 = 3 e) BODMAS states that brackets come before multiplication, so work out the bracket first: 3 × (4 + 2) = 3 × 6 = 18 Whack and zap mad professors and aliens!
