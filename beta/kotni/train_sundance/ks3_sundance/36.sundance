Original : Here are some points to remember: Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...when the writer talks about the "futility of life" he means... Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent) - for example ...the writer describes the landscape as a "desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold" he creates a picture that... Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.
