Original : > Fractions, Decimals and Percentages - F vs D Fractions, Decimals and Percentages - F vs D 0.38 means 38 hundredths, so 0.38 = Write 0.7 as a fraction in its simplest form means three tenths, so write it as 0.3 means seventeen hundredths, so write it as 0.17 When the bottom number isn't a multiple of 10, convert a fraction to a decimal by dividing the top number by the bottom.
