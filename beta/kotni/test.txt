Amtrak's new passenger train, the Acela Express, is flying down the tracks at warp speed--some people call it the Starship
The Acela is fast because the eight-car train has two locomotives. Most other trains have only one locomotive. One locomotive on Acela is located in front of the train, and the other locomotive is located in the rear. The two locomotives move Acela along at 150 miles per hour.
